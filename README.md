# Mail for you

"Mail for you" is a NuxtJS based app to create virtual letters. These can then be sent to other people via URL.
Each message can be combined with an optional photo.

Occasions for "Mail for you" can be an engagement, a pregnancy, a graduation, a won prize or any other happy message you want to send to someone.

"Mail for you" can be run by yourself or you can use the demo instance. The app does not need an API and database and all the information for the message is coded in the URL.
